socket-relay is a framework application for host multiplexion.
It is written in Python 3 and sources a configurations script,
/etc/socket-replay by default. It provides code that makes it
easy to setup a server that relays to another server.

This could for example be used if you have multiple computers
with web servers on one public IP address but want all computers
to use port 80. In this case you would configure port forwarding
on your router to computer A, and setup httpd on all computers to
use port 8080. On computer A you would setup socket-relay to
listen on port 80, read the header of incoming requests and
relay to the actual host but on port 8080 (and modify the header
to reflect the change in port.) This is of cause easier if
computer A does not have a httpd.
