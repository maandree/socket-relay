NAME
	socket-relay - Host multiplexion

SYNOPSIS
	socket-relay [OPTION | SCRIPT]

DESCRIPTION
	socket-relay is a framework application for host multiplexion.
	It is written in Python 3 and sources a configurations script,
	/etc/socket-replay by default. It provides code that makes it
	easy to setup a server that relays to another server.

	This could for example be used if you have multiple computers
	with Web servers on one public IP address but want all computers
	to use port 80. In this case you would configure port forwarding
	on your router to computer A, and setup httpd on all computers to
	use port 8080. On computer A you would setup socket-relay to
	listen on port 80, read the header of incoming requests and relay
	to the actual host but on port 8080 (and modify the header to
	reflect the change in port.) This is of cause easier if computer
	A does not have a httpd.
